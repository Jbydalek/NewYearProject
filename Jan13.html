							<h1>About-Face</h1>
							<h2>by Ikuhana Niro</h2>
							<h4>Sketchily showing young love.</h4>
<p>I love this work for being able to show an awkward, barely romantic version of young love. Where most doujins show a virgin as someone who looks like they belong in a hair and skin care ad as they’re being pounded, “About-Face” deals with an adorable couple just trying to hook up and get it over with to some extent.</p>
<p>I like that their relationship has already progressed to the point that they believe that now’s the time they should be having sex, but neither of them are confident enough to make the first move. The girl’s spry and hot-headed personality is a really fun to see mixed with the trepidation and uncomfortable a situation like this actually beings in real life. The guy is fun too, and while still a hella self-insert, gets some funny lines in there.</p>
<p>The art reminds me a lot of “My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness” in that in that it makes facial expressions simpler but draws bodies in a way more realistic light. This allows us to see more emotion from the face than the typical pallet of anime expressions, while also grounding the characters in what seems to be a down to earth story. It’s a real accomplishment that you can make something both emotionally raw and sexy, but the art helps go a long way in helping that work.</p>

							<p>4 out of 4. I really loved this one and it’s display of awkward teen romance. In a sea of porn star level feats by people who popped their cherry twenty seconds ago, a dose of realism is always nice to see.</p>
