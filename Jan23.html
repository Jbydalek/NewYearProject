							<h1>If We Could Meet by the Sea</h1>
							<h2>by Teri Terio</h2>
							<h4>My favorite hentai rears its beautiful head</h4>
<p>I haven’t made a secret that this is probably my favorite piece of porn that I’ve ever read/scene, and it’s my birthday, so this is the present I’m giving to myself.</p>
<p>The art is probably the only thing I can find a complaint with, but only if I’m reaaaly trying to nitpick. It’s art from a different time with a different style. It feels distinctly early 2000s, which personally I love. The scans from back when this hit the web weren’t as good, so the inks are a bit washed out. Still, the art complements the story to a tee, and is something that feels more nostalgic than dated, which works great with the story Teri Terio’s trying to tell.</p>
<p>That story is the main draw for me tbh. The main girl is adorably fun, and the main guy bounced off her well, even though he can’t keep it in his pants while he’s talking to her. The conversation isn’t all focused on bring flirty, and the best moments are more about helping the MC get back on his feet, making the ending where he leaves feels melancholy, but positive because he’s taking control of his life. </p>
<p>I could go on all day, but I’d rather just have you guys check it out down below. It’s my favorite for a reason, and that reason doesn’t even get into the magnificent tan lines and dark skin this book has going on. At 20 pages this is one of the shorter comics I’ve featured, but by far one of the best.</p>
<p>4 out of 4, hope we can meet again soon.</p>
